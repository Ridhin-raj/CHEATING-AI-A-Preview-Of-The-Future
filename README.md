### Project Description
Cheating AI is an interactive mobile application that demonstrates the inevitable dominance of artificial intelligence through the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. Our project serves as a compelling preview of a future where AI systems consistently outperform human decision-making, creating an unsettling yet thought-provoking gaming experience. The application intentionally ensures that users cannot win against the AI, symbolizing the growing disparity between human capabilities and artificial intelligence in strategic thinking and predictive¬†analysis.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's gaming landscape, players expect fair competition and equal chances of winning against AI opponents. However, this expectation masks a more profound reality - the rapid advancement of AI capabilities that will soon surpass human performance in virtually every domain. Traditional games provide users with false confidence in their ability to compete with intelligent systems, failing to prepare them for a future where AI dominance is absolute and¬†unavoidable.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our solution disrupts conventional gaming expectations by creating an intentionally unwinnable experience against AI. Through sophisticated prediction algorithms and strategic gameplay manipulation, we demonstrate AI's superior pattern recognition and decision-making capabilities. The application presents this reality through an engaging yet haunting user interface that gradually reveals the futility of human resistance against advanced AI systems. We've gamified the concept of AI supremacy to make users confront the uncomfortable truth about technological¬†evolution.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- DART
- FLUTTER
- MATERIAL.DART
- VS CODE,GIT,GITHUB


### Implementation
For Software:Initial Setup & Splash Screen
The application launches with a strategically designed splash screen that maintains user engagement for exactly¬†5¬†seconds.We engineered an intuitive home page featuring carefully positioned Rock Paper Scissors iconography within circular containers for enhanced visual appeal and user experience. The circular design pattern creates psychological comfort before users encounter the inevitable¬†AI¬†dominance.Core Gaming Interface
The main gameplay screen implements a dual-panel architecture:

User Interface Panel: Dedicated area for human interaction with three strategically positioned action buttons (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
AI Interface Panel: Mirror panel displaying AI responses with enhanced¬†visual¬†effects.Dynamic popup messages appear throughout gameplay, delivering carefully crafted content about AI dominance and technological supremacy. These messages escalate in intensity as the user's loss count increases, creating a progressively unsettling atmosphere that reinforces the project's¬†core¬†message.

WARNING SIGN IT SHOWS ABOUT THE FUTURE WORLD OF AI HOW THEY WILL REACT TO US AND SHOWS WE CANT DOMINATE THEM IN THE COMING ERA

FIRST I HAVE TO TELL SORRY HERE WE ARE UNABLE TO UPLOAD THE WORKFLOW DUE TO THE TIME LIMITATION AND DUE TO THE LAST MINUTE RUSH HERE WE HAVE GIVEN TWO PART ONE FOR USER AND ONE AI.FROM THE THREE OPTIONS AVAILABLE YOU CAN SELECT ANY ONE AND THE AI WILL ALWAYS TAKE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT USER TAKES AND THEY WILL WIN AND AFTER TWO SECONDS YOU CAN SEE THE POP MESSAGE ABOUT YOU CANT WIN AGAINST THE AI INDICATE THE DANGEROUS SIGN OF AI IF EVERYTHIG IS AI AUTOMATED THEN NO CHANCE OF DOMINATING THEM
